**An Ecommerce App with all the required features:**
Welcome to the Flutter-TDD-Clean-Architecture-E-Commerce-App GitHub repository! This project is a showcase of modern mobile app development practices, leveraging the power of Flutter, Test-Driven Development (TDD), Clean Architecture, and the BLoC (Business Logic Component) package. Built using the latest version of Flutter 3, this E-Commerce application exemplifies best practices for building scalable, maintainable, and efficient Flutter apps.

**BLoC State Management:** The app utilizes the BLoC pattern for state management. BLoC helps manage the flow of data and business logic in a clean and reactive manner, improving overall app performance.
**E-Commerce Functionality:** The app showcases a variety of E-Commerce features, such as product browsing, searching, cart and purchasing. Users can explore products, add them to their cart, and complete transactions seamlessly.
